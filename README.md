# createYourReadme



## Description

This project allows you to create your own personalized readme file, I thought this would be very useful considering you need to include a readme for each project. Some challenges I did face while creating this was trying to get everything you entered on the prompt to enter in the file. However, I learned through trial and error and messing with the consts in the array and the function.
